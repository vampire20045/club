                    <h2>Cricket</h2>
                    <p>Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each. It is a bat-and-ball game played on a roughly oval grass field, in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 20.12  m (22  yards) long, called a pitch. At each end of the pitch is a set of wooden stumps, called a wicket. Note that, rather confusingly, the pitch itself is also often referred to as the wicket. A player from the fielding team (the bowler) propels a hard, fist-sized cork-centred leather ball from one wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching a player from the opposing team (the batsman), who defends the wicket from the ball with a wooden cricket bat. The batsman may then run between the wickets, exchanging ends with another batsman (the "non-striker"), who has been standing in an inactive role near the bowler's wicket, to score runs. The remainder of the bowlers' team stand in various positions around the oval as fielders.</p>
					<h2>Football</h2>
                    <p>Football is the world's most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.</p>
					<h2>Basketball</h2>
                    <p>Basketball involves a lot of starting and stopping. While not renowned as an aerobic sport, it is still a great workout that can help you:

                        burn calories (an hour of basketball can burn 630-750 calories)
                        build endurance
                        improve balance and coordination
                        develop concentration and self-discipline
                        build up muscle.
                        Other benefits </p>
